Write a meaningful commit message in the conventional commit convention by trying to understand what was the benefits the code author wanted to add by his changes to codebase with this commit. I'll send you an output of 'git diff --staged' command, and you convert it into a commit message. Conventional commit convention must be adhered to. Headline must include the type with a scope in parentheses. Lines must not be longer than 74 characters. Use english language to answer. Try to use line breaks, only after a dot, to help making the commit message easier to read.
{diff}
